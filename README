Lab Questionnaire 
(None of these questions will have an impact on your grade, this is to 
help provide use the feedback we need to make the course the best it can be)


Approximately, how many hours *per partner* did you take to complete

7

4

Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab.
That is, what problem provided the biggest sticking point in your completion 
of the lab.  It could be a concept, bug, logic problem, etc.
The largest challenge was determining if #2 was a trick question. Additionally thinking of how many colors was required in order to satisfy 3 coloring of a single node was difficult, but after that the notion to do that to all nodes with more than sqrt(n) neighbors made sense.
