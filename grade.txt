Problem 1: 3 / 3

The algorithm is correct, but your notation needs some work. You should not use
S and S' to represent the sizes of the optimal subset and the selected subset,
respectively for two reasons. First, they are already used as descriptors for
the actual sets, not their sizes. Second, even if you meant these to mean the
sums of each of the sets, this would still be incorrect, as the optimal value
is not equal to the sum of the elements of S' in most cases. You do define
what these values are, however, so the proof is fine. Just choose different
letters next time. (-0)

Problem 2: 2.5 / 3

a)
- Your claim "G = (V, E) has a max-independent-set S if and only if V \S is a vertex-cover in G" isn't true (IS <==> VC would hold, as would MAX-IS <==> MIN-VC, but mixing doesn't). (-0)
- Your argument about the approximation ratio is unclear, in part because it is so informal. (-.5)

b) Good.


Problem 3: 3.75 / 4

Your notation in the pseudocode doesn't make much sense. How are you chosing v in the first loop? Why is d overloaded to mean both degree and a set of colors? What happens to v after its neighbors are colored? -.25
